## Challenges
One thing I had trouble on was cloning my repository, I kept receiving errors. I also struggled with deploying my url and using the functionality of pushing and pulling to and from github. I believe that my biggest challenge was understanding how to target specific elements in html with css, I was able to utilize differentiate classes and that helped me overcome this issue I was having.
